Code for various VEX Robots

This is for saving the code for VEX robots.  
Some are also experiments with unorthodox controls 
(for example, on the clawbot, on a vexRT controller, the movement is controlled by one joystick, and the claw and arm are controlled by the second one,
as opposed to having both joysticks control movement and the 4 back buttons control the claw and arm.
