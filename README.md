Code for various VEX Robots

This is for saving the code for VEX robots. Note that some of them may not work, as i haven't had a chance to test them recently. 
Some are also experiments with unorthodox controls 
(for example, on the clawbot, on a vexRT controller, the movement is controlled by one joystick, and the claw and arm are controlled by the second one,
as opposed to having both joysticks control movement and the 4 back buttons control the claw and arm.

For the (untested) tank bot, the user must input a password using the correct combinations of ABXY buttons. If they don't, they will be unable to use the launcher.

ANyway, feel free to use this code (after I test it and fix errors)
